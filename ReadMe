javascript is a single threaded programming language
callbacks are having super powers of handling async operations in javascript
async programming in js is exist bcause the callbacks are exist
issues with callback :
1. callback hell (nested callbacks) 2. inversion of control
one function in another function and another function is in other one it makes code unreadeable and unmaintainable
this structure is know as pyramid of Doom
2. Inversion of control:
we loose the control over code when we use the callbacks
